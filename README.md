# Architectural Style Classifier

## Overview
In this repository I will build and experiment with an image classification algorithm trained to recognize a variety of architectural styles. By analyzing the characteristics and features of different buildings, the model classifies them into specific architectural styles such as Gothic, Modern, Baroque, etc.

Once a working classification model has been achieved, I will create an architectural style transfer network. The goal of this network is to explore whether it is possible to use neural style transfer to transform a building of a certain architectural style into a different style. For example, can I make an Art Deco skyscraper look Baroque?
